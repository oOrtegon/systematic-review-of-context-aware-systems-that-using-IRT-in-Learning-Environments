abstract = "Personalization of learning is one of the most important ways of improving the effectiveness of education. At the same time, it is also a complex process that requires consideration of numerous factors such as learners’ profiles, learning materials and learning strategies. The Fuzzy Knowledge Management System (FKMS) for personalized learning presented in this paper considers all the above-mentioned factors as a whole, but not separately, in contrast to many studies on the research problem. The main objective of the system is to offer the most appropriate learning materials to the learners by considering their knowledge level and other learning characteristics. The knowledge base of the system contains course and concepts ontologies, learners’ profiles and learning objects knowledge. For expressing and processing of the knowledge, fuzzy logic methods are applied. Preliminary experimental results reveal the operability of the system."

However, no effective assessment mechanism for learning performance yet exists for e-learning systems. Learning performance assessment aims to evaluate what learners learned during the learning process. Traditional summative evaluation only considers final learning outcomes, without concerning the learning processes of learners. With the evolution of learning technology, the use of learning portfolios in a web-based learning environment can be beneficially adopted to record the procedure of the learning, which evaluates the learning performances of learners and produces feedback information to learners in ways that enhance their learning. Accordingly, this study presents a mobile formative assessment tool using data mining, which involves six computational intelligence theories, i.e. statistic correlation analysis, fuzzy clustering analysis, grey relational analysis, K-means clustering, fuzzy association rule mining and fuzzy inference, in order to identify the key formative assessment rules according to the web-based learning portfolios of an individual learner for the performance promotion of web-based learning. Restated, the proposed method can help teachers to precisely assess the learning performance of individual learner utilizing only the learning portfolios in a web-based learning environment. Hence, teachers can devote themselves to teaching and designing courseware, since they save a lot of time in measuring learning performance. More importantly, teachers can understand the main factors influencing learning performance in a web-based learning environment based on the interpretable learning performance assessment rules obtained. Experimental results indicate that the evaluation results of the proposed scheme are very close to those of summative assessment results and the factor analysis provides simple and clear learning performance assessment rules. Furthermore, the proposed learning feedback with formative assessment can clearly promote the learning performances and interests of learners."

abstract = "Adaptive learning systems aim to provide learning items tailored to the behavior and needs of individual learners. However, one of the outstanding challenges in adaptive item selection is that often the corresponding systems do not have information on initial ability levels of new learners entering a learning environment. Thus, the proficiency of those new learners is very difficult to be predicted. This heavily impairs the quality of personalized items' recommendation during the initial phase of the learning environment. In order to handle this issue, known as the cold-start problem, we propose a system that combines item response theory (IRT) with machine learning. Specifically, we perform ability estimation and item response prediction for new learners by integrating IRT with classification and regression trees built on learners’ side information. The goal of this work is to build a learning system that incorporates IRT and machine learning into a unified framework. We compare the proposed hybrid model to alternative approaches by conducting experiments on two educational data sets. The obtained results affirmed the potential of the proposed method. In particular, the obtained results indicate that IRT combined with Random Forests provides the lowest error for the ability estimation and the highest accuracy in terms of response prediction. This way, we deduce that the employment of machine learning in combination with IRT could indeed alleviate the effect of the cold start problem in an adaptive learning environment."

A profile of the EDM works was organized as a raw data base, which was transformed into an ad-hoc data base suitable to be mined. As result of the execution of statistical and clustering processes, a set of educational functionalities was found, a realistic pattern of EDM approaches was discovered, and two patterns of value-instances to depict EDM approaches based on descriptive and predictive models were identified. One key finding is: most of the EDM approaches are ground on a basic set composed by three kinds of educational systems, disciplines, tasks, methods, and algorithms each. The review concludes with a snapshot of the surveyed EDM works, and provides an analysis of the EDM strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats, whose factors represent, in a sense, future work to be fulfilled."

A paradigm shift from traditional learning style to technology innovations has opened up more opportunities for educators to practise accordingly. A small preliminary study was administered to examine teachers’ perceptions and readiness towards the utility of teaching and learning in a 2.0 environment as many previous studies had agreed that teachers’ perceptions and readiness are significant indicators in managing the technologies concerned. The data collected was analysed using Winsteps 3.71.0.1 which applied the Rasch Model based on Item Response Theory Models. The instrument reliability was measured by analysing item reliability index while the construct validity was examined by analysing the point-measure correlation index based on the three constructs respectively. The preliminary results of the study showed that the item reliability of three constructs were 0.96 and 0.98. Construct validity analysis revealed that the overall items in the constructs were correlated positively to measure the underlying construct. Thus, this instrument displayed significant reliability and construct validity in portraying the teachers’ positive perceptions and readiness in using Web 2.0 applications in their secondary education teaching. Consequently, the findings provide useful information which enables teachers to better understand the Web 2.0 technologies and integrate them into Malaysian education and at the same time benefit the learners."

How to select the proper learning objects (LOs) and provide a suitable learning path for learners is a complex task. The effectiveness of personalized recommender systems are mostly decided by the reasonable models of learners and learning resources. However, the modeling method needs further research for the learners’ special natures in e-learning. Heuristic methods have achieved significant successes on personalized recommendation, but the operators of some heuristic algorithms are often fixed, which diminishes the algorithms’ extendibility. In this paper, we propose a learner oriented recommendation approach based on mixed concept mapping and immune algorithm (IA). First, we build universal models for learners and LOs respectively, then apply mixed concept mapping to assimilate their attributes. Second, we model the learner oriented recommendation as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) which aims to minimize the penalty function of unsatisfied indexes. Last, we propose an advanced IA which takes the inherent characteristics of personalized recommendation into consideration, and we design the monomer vaccine and block vaccine to optimize the IA. Our approach is compared with other heuristic algorithms and traditional teaching method. From the experimental results, it can be concluded that the proposed approach shows high adaptability and efficiency in e-learning recommendation."

This paper presents an algorithm called EduRank for personalizing educational content to students that combines a collaborative filtering algorithm with voting methods. EduRank constructs a difficulty ranking for each student by aggregating the rankings of similar students using different aspects of their performance on common questions. These aspects include grades, number of retries, and time spent solving questions. It infers a difficulty ranking directly over the questions for each student, rather than ordering them according to the student’s predicted score. The EduRank algorithm was tested on two data sets containing thousands of students and a million records. It was able to outperform the state-of-the-art ranking approaches as well as a domain expert. EduRank was used by students in a classroom activity, where a prior model was incorporated to predict the difficulty rankings of students with no prior history in the system. It was shown to lead students to solve more difficult questions than an ordering by a domain expert, without reducing their performance."

Major findings include that most mobile-based assessment studies focused on formative assessments with elementary students and in STEM subjects. Most of the reviewed articles reported a significant positive impact on student learning performance, motivation and attitudes. Moreover, the study identified several gaps in the mobile assessment literature. More research is needed to investigate issues and concerns related to negative perceptions against mobile assessment, especially form the teachers’ point of view.

Researchers and managers recognize that recommender systems offer great opportunities and challenges for business, government, education, and other domains, with more recent successful developments of recommender systems for real-world applications becoming apparent. It is thus vital that a high quality, instructive review of current trends should be conducted, not only of the theoretical research results but more importantly of the practical developments in recommender systems. This paper therefore reviews up-to-date application developments of recommender systems, clusters their applications into eight main categories: e-government, e-business, e-commerce/e-shopping, e-library, e-learning, e-tourism, e-resource services and e-group activities, and summarizes the related recommendation techniques used in each category. It systematically examines the reported recommender systems through four dimensions: recommendation methods (such as CF), recommender systems software (such as BizSeeker), real-world application domains (such as e-business) and application platforms (such as mobile-based platforms). Some significant new topics are identified and listed as new directions.

To meet the needs of intended users, there is requirement for learning systems to embody technologies that support learners in achieving their learning goals and this process don’t happen automatically. This paper propose a novel approach for automated learning that is capable of detecting changing trends in learning behaviours and abilities through the use of process mining techniques. The goal is to discover user interaction patterns within learning processes, and respond by making decisions based on adaptive rules centred on captured user profiles. The approach applies semantic annotation of activity logs within the learning process in order to discover patterns automatically by means of semantic reasoning. Therefore, our proposed approach is grounded on Semantic Modelling and Process Mining techniques. To this end, it is possible to apply effective reasoning methods to make inferences over a Learning Process Knowledge-Base that leads to automated discovery of learning patterns or behaviour."

However, such a two-dimensional approach is suboptimal from both a conceptual and policy perspective, as it does not consider individual differences that determine energy-saving behavior. We propose a different, one-dimensional approach, applying Campbell's Paradigm through the Rasch model, in which both curtailment and efficiency measures are intermixed on a single scale and ordered according to their behavioral costs. By matching these behavioral costs to individual energy-saving attitudes, we investigate to what extent attitude-tailored energy-saving advice can help consumers to save energy. We present the results of two studies. The first study (N = 263) reliably calibrated a one-dimensional Rasch scale that consists of 79 energy-saving measures, suitable for advice. The second study employed this scale to investigate how users (N = 196) evaluate attitude-tailored energy-saving advice in a web-based energy recommender system. Results indicate that Rasch-based recommendations can be used to effectively tailor energy-saving advice and that such attitude-tailored advice is more adequate than a number of non-personalized approaches."

Our strategy is to cover all the required topics at least to some extent rather than learn few topics perfectly. The proposed method uses utility-based recommending and conceptbased knowledge modeling. We evaluate our approach in the domain of learning programming."

abstract = "Computer programming ability is a type of knowledge that is considered to be quite complex because it demands many cognitive skills and extensive practice to be mastered. However, formative assessment is a strategy that can improve learning. For this reason, we developed a recommender system to aid in making choices on programming practices by recommending classes of activities. This system provides instructors with a means of semi-automatic assessment, with more individualised and accurate activities tailored to the needs of their learners. To achieve this goal, the system of recommendations analyses multidimensional profiles of new students and seeks the best match for them among profiles in the logs of previous recommendations, which were made manually. Based on these matched profiles, the system can now recommend to new learners classes of activities that are indicated by similar profiles that have already received recommendations. The recommendation of activities is thus treated by our system as a multi-label classification task in which each student’s profile is associated with one or more classes of programming activities. The results obtained under different evaluation metrics confirm that the chosen algorithm, the ML-kNN, correctly mimics human decisions on the recommendations of classes of activities most of the time. Furthermore, these metrics provide relevant information for instructors to perform better actions with regard to formative assessments."

abstract = "The Internet creates excellent opportunities for businesses to provide personalized online services to their customers. Recommender systems are designed to automatically generate personalized suggestions of products/services to customers. Because various uncertainties exist within both product and customer data, it is a challenge to achieve high recommendation accuracy. This study develops a hybrid recommendation approach which combines user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques with fuzzy set techniques and applies it to mobile product and service recommendation. It particularly implements the proposed approach in an intelligent recommender system software called Fuzzy-based Telecom Product Recommender System (FTCP-RS). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the initial application shows that the FTCP-RS can effectively help customers to select the most suitable mobile products or services."

abstract = "In e-learning, one of the main difficulties is recommending learning materials that users can complete on time. It becomes more challenging when users cannot devote enough time to learn the entire course. In this paper, we describe two approaches to maximize users’ scores for a course while satisfying their time constraints. These approaches recommend successful paths based on the available time and knowledge background of users. We first briefly explain a method that has a similar goal to our method, and highlight its drawbacks. We then describe our proposal, which works based on a two-layered course graph (lesson and Learning Object (LO) layers; a lesson includes a few LO). Initially, our method uses the Depth First Search algorithm (DFS) to find all lesson sequences in the graph that start by a lesson (opted by a user). It then assigns LO for lessons of paths and estimates their score and time. Finally, a path that satisfies the user’s limited time while maximizing his/her score is recommended lesson by lesson. During a path recommendation, if the user could not get the estimated score from a lesson, our method recommends auxiliary LO for that lesson. To evaluate our method, we first assessed the quality of our estimation methods and then evaluate our recommender in a live environment. Results show that our estimation methods outperformed the ones in the literature. Results also present within the same amount of time, the users of our recommender proceeded more on the course than the users of another e-learning system."
