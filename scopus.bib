	abstract = {Programming education has recently received increased attention due to growing demand for programming and information technology skills. However, a lack of teaching materials and human resources presents a major challenge to meeting this demand. One way to compensate for a shortage of trained teachers is to use machine learning techniques to assist learners. This article proposes a learning path recommendation system that applies a recurrent neural network to a learner's ability chart, which displays the learner's scores. In brief, a learning path is constructed from a learner's submission history using a trial-and-error process, and the learner's ability chart is used as an indicator of their current knowledge. An approach for constructing a learning path recommendation system using ability charts and its implementation based on a sequential prediction model and a recurrent neural network, are presented. Experimental evaluation is conducted with data from an e-learning system.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to identify the different sequence generation techniques for learning, which are applied to a broad category of personalized learning experiences. The papers have been classified using different attributes, such as the techniques used for sequence generation, attributes used for sequence generation; whether the learner is profiled automatically or manually; and whether the path generated is dynamic or static.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The search for terms learning sequence generation and E-learning produced thousands of results. The results were filtered, and a few questions were answered before including them in the review. Papers published only after 2005 were included in the review.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings of the paper were: most of the systems generated non-adaptive paths. Systems asked the learners to manually enter their attributes. The systems used one or a maximum of two learner attributes for path generation.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The review pointed out the importance and benefits of learning sequence generation systems. The problems in existing systems and future areas of research were identified which will help future researchers to pursue research in this area.},

Reaching this level in an intelligent tutoring system is a challenge even today given the advanced developments in the field. This article focuses on ITS, mimicking a human tutor in terms of providing a curriculum sequence exclusive for the learner. Unsuitable courseware disorients the learner and thus degrades the overall performance. A bug model approach has been used for curriculum design and its re-alignment as per requirements and is demonstrated through a prototype tutoring recommender system, SeisTutor, developed for this purpose. The experimental results indicate an enhanced learning gain through a curriculum recommender approach of SeisTutor as opposed to its absence.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to analyze the occurrence of terms to identify the relevant topics and then to investigate the area (based on topics) of hospitality services that is highly associated with relationship quality. This research represents an opportunity to fill the gap in the current literature, and clarify the understanding of guests’ affective states by evaluating all aspects of their relationship with a hotel.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This research focuses on natural opinions upon which machine-learning algorithms can be executed: text summarization, sentiment analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Our data set contains 47,172 reviews of 33 hotels located in Las Vegas, and registered with Yelp. A component-based structural equation modeling (partial least squares (PLS)) is applied, with a dual – exploratory and predictive – purpose.
            
            
              Findings
              To maintain a truly loyal relationship and to achieve competitive success, hospitality managers must take into account both tangible and intangible features when allocating their marketing efforts to satisfaction-, trust- and commitment-based cues. On the other hand, the application of the PLS predict algorithm demonstrates the predictive performance (out-of-sample prediction) of our model that supports its ability to predict new and accurate values for individual cases when further samples are added.
            
            
              Originality/value
              LDA and PLS produce relevant informative summaries of corpora, and confirm and address more specifically the results of the previous literature concerning relationship quality. Our results are more reliable and accurate (providing insights not indicated in guests’ ratings into how hotels can improve their services) than prior statistical results based on limited sample data and on numerical satisfaction ratings alone.},

A total of 153 participants answered an anonymous online survey, completed the Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test – Revised (CUDIT-R), and indicated their numbers of regular smoking partners, and times and places cannabis was normally purchased. Recent cannabis smokers had higher CUDIT-R scores and purchased cannabis from more places more often. Multiple regression considered subscales of the CUDIT-R. Greater cannabis consumption was associated with more smoking partners and purchases of cannabis at more times and places. Cannabis dependence was associated with cannabis purchases from more places and times and reports that there were more people prepared to do them favors. Harmful use was associated with more purchases at more locations. Patterns of cannabis foraging were compared with foraging behaviors previously observed for caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. The data could inform the development and use of social media and location-aware services seeking to target risky substance use.},

For the quantitative data, the study was conducted in accordance with the pre-test and post-test-based two group quasi-experimental model. For the qualitative data, the descriptive analysis technique was used. The independent sample t-test and paired simple t-test were employed in the analysis phase. According to the findings, mobile learning positively affected students' academic achievement on the DBMS course, in that the students supported by mobile learning were more successful than students supported only by face-to-face training method. Finally, it is seen that the students have emphasized themes of motivation, 1-1 access, and an interest in terms of the effect of m-learning approach on academic success.},

The popularity of campus network facili-ties in various universities provides hardware support for the establishment of a personalized English teaching platform based on campus network. The study is aimed at designing a personalized English teaching platform based on campus network, which takes VBSCRIPT as programming language and SQL Server as database software of the platform, completing the interactive processing of the da-ta based on the data structure of client computer/server (B/S). First, the paper in-troduces the relevant teaching and education theories, laying theoretical and tech-nical basis for the design of personalized English teaching platform in combina-tion with the computer technology used in the design of the platform. The combi-nation of questionnaire and analytic study is used in the design of the system from various aspects, and makes the design of the platform come true. At last, the testing of the system verifies that the system meets the relevant functional re-quirement. The platform would provide an open environment for English learning and stimulating the guidance of teachers and is of great significance to improve the level of college English teaching.},

	abstract = {In the past decades, various systems have been proposed to provide students with a better learning environment by taking personal factors into account. Learning styles have been one of the widely adopted factors in the previous studies as a reference for adapting learning content or organizing the content. However, very few researchers give an idea of matching e-media with appropriate teaching and learning styles and very few studies give an idea of which appropriate combinations of electronic media and learning styles are more effective than other. In this paper, the authors aim to prototype an AFDPC-FS system (Adaptation with Four Dimensional Personalization Criteria based on Felder Silverman model). Their system presents a general framework for combining and adapting teaching strategies, learning styles and electronic media according to Felder-Silverman's learning style model. An experiment was designed to explore the effect of adaptation to different learning styles when learning materials were matched with learning styles. In particular it was set up to see whether there are significant differences in learning achievement and cognitive load between two groups, an experimental group who studied with learning style-fit version and a control group who studied with non-fit version of the system without adaptation to learning styles. The experimental results showed that the proposed system could improve the learning achievements of the students. Moreover, it was found that the students' cognitive load was significantly decreased.},

	abstract = {In this paper an interactive recommending agent is proposed which helps an e-learner to enhance the quality of learning experience resulting in efficient achievement of learning objectives. The agent achieves this with the help of a fuzzy rule base working on a variety of learning materials and recommending the appropriate learning path through them. In a learner-centric environment the learning behaviour of a learner may vary to a great extent due to the characteristics of the learner and his environment. Students are often misled while choosing the appropriate path of web learning tools owing to non-availability of a human teacher/guide. By the response of a learner to different positive and negative motivation factors the proposed system employs a fuzzy machine that is fed with realization parameters e.g. Satisfied, Depressed etc. The fuzzy machine working on the paradigm of fuzzy inference system processes these realization parameters with the help of a fuzzy rule base to produce the crisp measures of the learner’s cognitive states in terms of Belief, Behaviour and Attitude. On the basis of these defuzzified crisp diagnostic parameters the proposed system will enhanced the quality of learning experience of an e-learner. To ensure this the system will provide more detailed discussion on the subject matter along with some additional learning tools. Learners often get confused to select the proper tools among various. Therefore the proposed system will also suggest most popular path among those learners with the same understanding. This recommendation comes from the analysis of data mining result. The system was tested with a wide variety of school-level students. The response obtained indicates that it is able to enhance the quality of learning experience through its recommendation.},

	abstract = {On any type of course (on site or online), a learner is evaluated whether he has acquired the knowledge and competences provided in the course. The evaluation should be performed by evaluating his progression by means of the interaction in the classroom or assessment activities. Mostly, assessment activities are used to check the level of expertise of the learner. Typically, the assessment model and assessment activities of subjects in official programmes are the same for all the learners, since they should be evaluated having the same opportunities and conditions. However, when the learner is evaluated based on a continuous assessment model, he is demonstrating on each activity his knowledge and proficiency level and, at the same time, his reputation could be also built based on the actions he is performing within the course. Therefore, the assessment model can be particularly adapted for each learned based on this information. In this paper, we present a general system to adapt any component of the assessment process (model, activity, question…) based on different evidences gathered from the learning process of the learner.},

With analogue content digitized as a common form of knowledge delivery, methodologies equipped with current technologies have produced new perspectives on English Language Learning. This paper reviews the status, context, teaching parameters, assessment parameters, teaching strategies and usability in the current research capacity of ELT, highlighting the current works with technologies in their content delivery methods. Emerging technologies in ELT has also inspires the other spectrum of study involving the usability of technological interfaces, which has evolved constantly with the progression of human and computer interactivity. The aim of this research is to rediscover usability evolution surrounding the technologies in ELT and to redefine the gap existed in between English learning and tools interactivity. Current technologies and usability measures used in ELT will be discussed, highlighting the current trends in gauging interface interaction. A summary of comparative results in the aforementioned works will also be highlighted in this review paper, together with the categorization of reviewed parameters, variables and metrics in ELT. The reviews conducted have shown that there are still many unexplored areas in ELT, ELT technologies and usability in ELT.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Despite the hundreds of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) publications over the past twenty years, statistically reliable measures of learning outcomes are few and far between. In part, this is due to the fact that well over half of all MALL-related studies report no objectively quantifiable learning outcomes, either because they did not involve MALL implementation projects, or if they did, learning gains were only based on subjective teacher assessments and/or student self-evaluations. Even more so, the paucity of statistically reliable learning outcome data stems from the short duration of projects and small numbers of students involved. Of the 291 distinct studies examined in this review only 35 meet minimal conditions of duration and sample size, i.e., ten experimental subjects over a period of at least a month. Sixteen of these suffer from serious design shortcomings, leaving only nineteen MALL studies that can reliably serve as a basis for determining the learning outcomes of mobile-based language applications.

	abstract = {In a ubiquitous environment, high-accuracy data analysis is essential because it affects real-world decision-making. However, in the real world, user-related data from information systems are often missing due to users’ concerns about privacy or lack of obligation to provide complete data. This data incompleteness can impair the accuracy of data analysis using classification algorithms, which can degrade the value of the data. Many studies have attempted to overcome these data incompleteness issues and to improve the quality of data analysis using classification algorithms. The performance of classification algorithms may be affected by the characteristics and patterns of the missing data, such as the ratio of missing data to complete data. We perform a concrete causal analysis of differences in performance of classification algorithms based on various factors. The characteristics of missing values, datasets, and imputation methods are examined. We also propose imputation and classification algorithms appropriate to different datasets and circumstances.},
